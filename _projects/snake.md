    <p>This game is my own modified version of the original game <i>Snake</i>. Unlike the original game, there are two different types of fruit that will appear on the screen â€” apples and blueberries. Each fruit consumed will increase the length of the snake by a different amount (i.e., blueberries = +2 and apples = +4). There are also various obstacles (i.e., yellow squares) placed at random locations on the screen. (They refresh with each round.) If the snake hits an obstacle, it will head in a completely new direction. Be wary!</p>

    <p><b>Gameplay</b></p>

    <hr>

    <p>In <i>Snake</i>, the player controls a line, or "snake," that moves around a screen, collecting items (often depicted as food) to grow longer. The objective is to consume as many items as possible without running into the snake's own body or the edges of the screen. The game continues until the snake crashes into itself or a boundary, ending the session.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Controls:</b> Typically, the snake is controlled using arrow keys on a keyboard, a joystick, or touch controls on a mobile device. The snake moves in a continuous direction until the player changes its course by pressing the corresponding control.</li>
        <li><b>Growth and Score:</b> Each item the snake consumes causes it to grow longer, which increases the game's difficulty as avoiding collisions becomes more challenging. The player's score increases with each item consumed, rewarding skillful navigation and planning.</li>
    </ul>
