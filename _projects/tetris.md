    <p><b>Gameplay</b></p>

    <hr>

    <p>The core gameplay of <i>Tetris</i> involves arranging falling blocks, called Tetriminos, to form complete horizontal lines on the playfield. Each Tetrimino is composed of four squares arranged in different shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, and L).</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Controls:</b> Players can move Tetriminos left or right, rotate them clockwise or counterclockwise, and speed up their descent. The objective is to fit these shapes together in such a way that they form complete lines, which then disappear, leaving more space on the playfield.</li>
        <li><b>Scoring:</b> Points are awarded for completing lines. Completing multiple lines at once earns higher scores, with a Tetris (clearing four lines simultaneously) being the highest single-move score.</li>
