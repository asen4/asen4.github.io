title: CPU Design & Implementation
description: Throughout the course of the semester, we were tasked with building and designing a five-stage pipelined CPU. Verilog, a hardware description language, was used to write and program the CPU. In the first three labs, we mainly focused on implementing the five separate stages of the CPU pipelining process-instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode (ID), execution (EX), memory access (MEM), and writeback (WB). In the final project, we updated the instructions from load word instructions to r-type instructions and made some modifications to the Control Unit so that it could generate the appropriate signals to handle stalls and forwarding to avoid any data hazards and optimize executions as much as possible.

Generally speaking, pipelining allows for increased throughput and decreased response time by executing several instructions in a “staggered” order simultaneously in various stages of the pipeline. This parallel processing technique reduces the response time required to complete a series of instructions, increasing the efficiency of the processor as a result. Moreover, pipelining allows for a higher clock frequency since each of the individual stages can operate simultaneously, or in parallel, that improves the performance of the processor design.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
