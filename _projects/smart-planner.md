    <p>If you‚Äôre currently a school student, undergraduate student, or even graduate student, tell me this situation doesn‚Äôt sound familiar to you. As your professor finishes their lecture, you take a quick glance at the homework board to see the due dates for upcoming assignments. Seeing so much work to do this weekend, you take between, say, thirty seconds to a minute furiously scribbling down the due dates into your handy-dandy planner. As you head over to your next class, you see the homework board and realize you have more work to do. Groaning, you take between a minute to one and a half minutes copying down the due dates into your planner. At the next class, you spend between thirty seconds to a minute writing down the due dates. The cycle repeats again and again, where, by the end of the day, you wasted nearly between three to six minutes writing down the due dates into your planner. Don‚Äôt you think that time could be better used somewhere else? Maybe you could chat with your friends or ask the professor a question. Wouldn't it be better if these reminders were automatically written for you in a safe place everyday? To make matters worse, you enter your chemistry class Monday morning and realize you forgot to do your homework because you had forcibly crammed the due date into the bottom corner of your planner. ‚ÄúHow careless of you! It‚Äôs so tiny that it‚Äôs barely even legible. It‚Äôs no wonder you forgot to do it,‚Äù your professor answers in response to your dilemma. Don't you hate this feeling that lingers when you miss the deadline?</p>

    <p>Unless you‚Äôre like a few select people who can memorize the due dates and keep track of everything in your head, then I have news for you. Get Smart Planner! This is an app that enables you to stay organized and seamlessly keep track of all your upcoming assignments. Instead of having to write assignment deadlines on the homework board everyday, professors have the ability to create assignment reminders in the app in just 1-2 minutes. Students can look at these reminders whenever they wish throughout the day. Any user can also give comments and ratings to other users, regardless of whether they‚Äôre professors or students. Know how others feel about you! Say goodbye to outdated paper daily planners, and say hello to <i>Smart Planner</i>! Happy planning ‚Äî and studying!</p>

    <p><i>P.S.</i> I am certainly not an official conservationist, but I do know that billions of trees are wasted in producing paper weekly planners. So why join those foul "tree killers?" Get the digital version: <i>Smart Planner</i>.</p>
