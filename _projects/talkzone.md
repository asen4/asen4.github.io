    <p>Tell me this doesn‚Äôt sound familiar to you. You‚Äôre in a FaceTime call, Zoom call, Google hangout, WeChat, or Skype on your phone or tablet with someone, let‚Äôs say your grandma for example. She tries to show you a picture on her phone or wave a piece of writing in front of you. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to see,‚Äù you reply. Even though this is a simple example, isn‚Äôt it a pain to video call somebody again and again on a small phone or tablet screen? Wouldn‚Äôt you prefer to have a nice and decent conversation with them on a larger screen instead like a TV? That way it would make it seem like they're actually in the room with you‚Äîlike an almost life-size display. And it sure would be easier to see what grandma‚Äôs trying to show you.</p>

    <p>But wait. Can‚Äôt I already do that by hooking up a HDMI cable between my laptop and the TV? Yes, you‚Äôre right, but think about the extra steps of having to get up and fetch the HDMI cable and then connect the two devices together and then set it up on the TV. A pain, right? What if I told you an app could do this step by simply pressing one button? A lot easier, right?</p>

    <p>That‚Äôs exactly one of the features of <i>TalkZone</i>. <i>TalkZone</i> enables you to video call somebody from your own TV for a better video-calling experience. It also contains some of the typical characteristics of a social networking app (e.g. instant-messaging and posting) in a more EASY-TO-USE and SIMPLIFIED setting without a gazillion buttons, unlike Facebook, Twitter, or any other "advanced" social media app.</p>

    <p>As a fun fact, I was inspired to create the app after watching my mother and grandmother video call each on a regular basis. After seeing them have difficulties carrying a phone or tablet everywhere, I decided to work on developing an Android app to enable them to cast their screens to a larger TV screen instead. I ultimately hope that people who face similar difficulties will see this app as a solution.</p>

    <p><b>Additional charges will apply as necessary for international phone calls, depending on your mobile plan. <i>TalkZone</i> will not be held responsible.</b></p>

    <p>HOME SCREEN: In the home screen (left-hand image), you can publish your own posts to other users on the app. If you feel something is worth everybody knowing (e.g. a news event, a latest music release, etc.), then this is the place to do so! We ask that you keep humorous posts at a minimum, so the page can be filled with the more "important content."</p>

    <p>MESSAGES SCREEN: In the messages screen (left-hand image), you can message with another user, just like in any other instant-messaging app. In addition to texts, you can share images, PDFs, and documents with others too! You also have the option to delete messages for yourself or for everyone.</p>

    <p>VIDEO CALL SCREEN: This is where the magic happens! In the video call screen (right-hand image), you can make conference calls to other users by providing a secret code to join the meeting. If you wish to start a conference call on your TV, then click the cast icon button on the bottom-right hand of the screen to cast your mobile screen to the TV. Then, simply provide the secret code and join the meeting. That's it‚Äîit's that easy!</p>
