  <p>I am Anubhav, a current senior and Schreyer Scholar at the Pennsylvania State University in State College, PA. I aspire to build solutions that are targeted for everyday individuals. These solutions can range from mechanical components in vacuuming robots to mobile apps that can automate tedious activities or simplify everyday mundane tasks (e.g., math homework verification scripts or an app that helps me implement a personalized study habit). As I gradually build towards this goal, I have already developed a few Android apps for sheer fun: (1) a digital student planner app called <i>Smart Planner</i>, (2) a video-calling/casting media app called <i>TalkZone</i>, and (3) a simple social media app called <i>TagOut!</i>. Quite recently, I have also published an e-commerce app that's powered by the React Native framework called <i>Nittany Retails</i>, where students can buy, sell, and request any goods they wish for all within our campus community. (Navigate to the "projects" tab, and feel free to read more about their descriptions to find how they can solve pain points in everyday life.) To help avid, ambitious programmers learn more about Java, I have authored and published a two-part written guide to the fundamentals and advanced theories of Java, which is only available on Amazon as a Kindle eBook, hardcover, and paperback. As an aspiring computer engineering major, I would like to learn all in all how to write better software while also tackling more complicated problems that require either artificial intelligence (AI) or hardware.</p>
