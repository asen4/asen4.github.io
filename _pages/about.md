I am Anubhav, a junior studying at The Pennsylvania State University in State College, PA. My interests lie primarily towards application development. Through my website, I hope to portray my interests which range from programming to creative writing â€” not to mention playing video games. I am Anubhav, a current junior and Schreyer Scholar at The Pennsylvania State University in State College, PA. I aspire to build solutions that are targeted for everyday individuals. These solutions can range from mechanical components in vacuuming robots to mobile apps that can automate tedious activities or simplify everyday mundane tasks (e.g. math homework verification scripts or an app that helps me implement a personalized study habit). As I gradually build towards this goal, I've already developed a few Android apps for sheer fun: (1) a digital student planner app called "Smart Planner!", (2) a video-calling/casting media app called "TalkZone", and (3) a simple social media app called "TagOut!". (Read more about their descriptions to find how they can solve pain points in everyday life.) To help eager-to-learn programmers learn more about Java, I've authored and published a handy, two-part written guide to the fundamentals and advanced theories of Java, which is only available on Amazon as a Kindle eBook, hardcover, and paperback. As an aspiring computer science major, I would like to learn how to write better software while also tackling more complicated problems that require either artificial intelligence (AI) or hardware.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
