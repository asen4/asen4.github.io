    <p>With regards to my “This I Believe” podcast, I was hoping to either write about how there is no substitute for effort/hard work or how to find a home for oneself. As for my Passion Blog, I was torn between either continuing writing about my obsession with puzzles from last semester or writing about surreal natural phenomena that occur in the world (e.g., shooting stars, whirlpools, etc.). I will most probably go with the latter. As for my Civic Issues Blog, I was contemplating on writing about prevalent issues like climate action or starvation concerns, especially in developing countries.</p>
