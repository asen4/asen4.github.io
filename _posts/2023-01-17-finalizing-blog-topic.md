    <p>For this semester, I plan on writing my Passion blogs on surreal natural phenomena that occur in the world (e.g., moonbows, shooting stars, whirlpools, etc.). As for my Civic Issues blog, I plan on writing about starvation concerns and global hunger in todayâ€™s society. I look forward to getting started next week!</p>
