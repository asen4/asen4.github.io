    <p>As I stepped off the plane, I felt a heat wave engulf me until sweat dripped from my forehead. Discomforted, I asked about the outside temperature. “It’s 110℉—that’s India for you,” a local replied.</p>

    <p>As one of the most hotly contested topics, the climate change crisis has accelerated rapidly in recent years. Within the past few decades, human activities like burning greenhouse gas-producing fossil fuels, cutting down forests, using transportation have dramatically increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and, consequently, the average global temperature. Rising temperatures are causing environmental degradation, natural disasters, weather extremes, food and water insecurities, and economic disruptions to name a few. As sea levels continue to rise, glaciers melt, coral reefs die, oceans acidify, and forests burn, the cost of climate change reaches irreversible heights.</p>

    <p>However, many organizations worldwide have already taken measures to counteract the issue. For example, in the automotive industry, Tesla has already produced nearly 1.91 million electric vehicles since 2009, in accordance with its mission to “accelerate the world’s transition into sustainable energy.” Additionally, at least 92.7 billion solar panels have been installed across the world today, producing cleaner renewable energy that keeps us from burning fossil fuels. Some proposals for the future involve cooling Earth’s surface by spraying artificially-made, reflective particles into the planet’s atmosphere, scattering and reflecting sunlight back into space. Other proposals involve planting the oceans with iron to cause large-scale phytoplankton growth, thereby removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Such methods could potentially work but require further research.</p>

    <p>Right now, I will view this issue through a temporal and representational lens, especially focusing on how many people overlook the importance and prevalence of this issue. By citing the long-term effects like hotter temperatures, more severe storms, and increased droughts to name a few, I ultimately hope to balance talk of urgency with hopeful and creative ideas if we, as a society, are able to inspire positive change and finally put an end to this.</p>
