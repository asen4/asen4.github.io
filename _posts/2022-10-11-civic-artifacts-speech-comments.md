After viewing Emma’s speech on Penn State’s Food Waste Initiative, I really liked how she touched upon the faulty UI design of the food wastage numbers displayed here in the dining halls. She remarked on faults like one important figure being completely blocked from sight by another view and the difficulty in reading the screen as the text color blends in with the background color. I personally felt her delivery wasn’t as strong as the points she made in her presentation. She could have used more hand gestures and changed the tone of her voice to place emphasis on key points like when she was analyzing the idea of the thumbs down emoji derailing motivation and the need to preserve food.

In my speech, I believe I could have condensed the information a bit more by spending more time talking about one attribute like Emma’s speech, not trying to name (without any further analysis) all the attributes worthy of analysis in the artifact. I could have spent more time talking about how our pursuit of advancing technology has become the byproduct of our actions from hurting Mother Nature. With regards to my delivery, I could have tried to place more emphasis on the word _our_ when mentioning how our selfishness has caused us to spread across the world and create huge changes to the atmosphere, landscapes, and ecosystems (i.e., creating advanced infrastructure through our joint efforts) without any care for their effects on the environment.
