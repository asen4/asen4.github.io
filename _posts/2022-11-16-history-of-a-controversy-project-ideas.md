    <p>Gun violence has been a highly-debated topic in the country for the last several years. At a time, it seemed like there was either a mass shooting or other act of gun violence everyday, although the situation has normalized in the past few months. While some gun control advocates uphold and support the Second Amendment, others feel they are a harm towards our safety at large.</p>

    <p>Maybe we could also consider doing something on universal healthcare. While universal healthcare already exists in countries like Sweden, Hong Kong, and Kuwait, where the local and federal government pays for most costs associated with healthcare coverage, there has been widespread disagreement over how to control high insurance costs, bureaucratic treatment obstacles, and deep socioeconomic inequalities.</p>

    <p>The Russian-Ukrainian conflict could also be considered another option. Was it ethical? We would, of course, have to examine the relationships between Russia and Ukraine over history, delving more into the issue from the perspective of both sides.</p>

    <p>We could also consider the climate change crisis. Is global warming real? Is it caused mainly by human activity? How harmful is it likely to be? What can we do about it? Some skeptics argue that the dangers of climate change are exaggerated, while others accept global warming as real but dismiss evidence that suggests itâ€™s connected to human activity. Government regulation, suppression of scientific data for political gain, and international agreements on climate change often play a role in the debate.</p>
